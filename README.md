<h1 style="text-align: center;">Navigating Uganda’s Interbank Currents: A Data Odyssey</h1>

## Introduction.

Picture this: In the heart of East Africa, a nation's economic destiny unfolds in the quiet exchanges between banks. Every day, financial institutions in Uganda engage in a delicate dance of lending and borrowing, their moves choreographed by a single, powerful number - the interbank rate. This rate, often overlooked by the general public, holds the power to influence everything from the cost of your next business loan to the interest earned on your savings account.

"The interbank rate is the heartbeat of a nation's financial system," as renowned economist John Maynard Keynes once observed. "It sets the rhythm for economic growth and stability."

This project delves into Uganda’s interbank rates from 2012 to 2024, using Excel for organizing and extracting data, Python for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau further analysis,visualisation and creating interactive dashboards.

### Why does this matter?
Interbank rates are more than just numbers on a banker's ledger. They are the invisible hand that shapes monetary policy, influences inflation, and ultimately affects the financial well-being of every Ugandan citizen. By understanding these rates, we gain insight into the nation's economic health, its challenges, and its triumphs.

This analysis will take you from the dizzying heights of 2012, where rates peaked at a staggering 18.879% for 7-day rates, to the valleys of recent years where rates have moderated. As we dive into this data, we're not just crunching numbers; we're telling the story of a nation's economic journey. We'll uncover the tales hidden in the trends, the dramas played out in the dips and spikes, and the potential future written in the current trajectories.

Buckle up for a journey through the peaks and troughs of Uganda's financial heartbeat - a story told through the lens of interbank rates, where every percentage point tells a story.

## Understanding the Data
### Trends in Uganda's Interbank Rates (2012-2024)
Our journey into Uganda's financial landscape begins with an overview of the interbank rates from 2012 to 2024. This analysis provides a bird's-eye view of the trends and fluctuations in the country's financial system over more than a decade.

Let's start by examining the visual representation of the data:
<img src="Assets/Tableau Charts/Avg inter bank rates over years(2012-2024).png" alt="Avg inter bank rates over years(2012-2024)"/>
<p align="center"><i>This graph illustrates the annual mean rates for three key metrics: the overnight rate, the seven-day rate, and the overall rate. Each line tells a story of Uganda's economic journey, with peaks and troughs reflecting various economic conditions and policy decisions.</i></p>

#### Key Observations:

**Peak in 2012:** The most striking feature of this graph is the pronounced peak in 2012. During this year, we observed the highest rates across all three categories.

<p><i>In 2012, Uganda’s interbank rates were notably high compared to subsequent years. The overall rate averaged 16.64%, with the seven-day rate at 18.96% and the overnight rate at 15.23%. January 2012 saw peak rates, with the overnight rate at 25.90%, the seven-day rate at 28.54%, and the overall rate at 26.65%, indicating significant financial stress or tight monetary policy. Rates generally trended downward throughout the year, with the overnight rate dropping to 10.00% by September, reflecting eased monetary conditions. The seven-day rate consistently exceeded the overnight rate, with an average spread of 3.73 percentage points, suggesting a premium for longer-term lending. Rates were volatile, with the overnight rate ranging from 25.90% in January to 10.00% in September, and the seven-day rate consistently higher, especially in February and August.</i></p>

**General Downward Trend:** Following the 2012 peak, we see a general downward trend in all three rates. This decline indicates a gradual easing of monetary policy over the years, potentially aimed at stimulating economic growth by reducing borrowing costs.

**Convergence of Rates:** As we move towards more recent years, we notice a convergence of the three rates. This narrowing spread between overnight and seven-day rates indicates increased stability and predictability in the short-term money market.

**Recent Uptick:** Towards the end of the observed period, focusing on 12 months (July 2023-June 2024), we see a slight upturn in rates. This recent increase might signal a shift in monetary policy stance, possibly in response to changing economic conditions or inflationary concerns.

<p ><i>The seven-day rate consistently remained higher than the overnight rate between this period. Overall rates fluctuated between 10.106% and 12.005%.
There was a significant drop in rates in June 2024. The highest rates were observed in April and May 2024. 
The Average rate difference (Seven-day - Overnight): 0.3239166666666667
    
This indicates that longer-term lending (seven-day) was generally perceived as riskier than overnight lending. </i></p>

**Volatility:** The graphs reveal periods of significant volatility, particularly in the earlier years. This volatility gradually decreases over time, suggesting an increasing maturity and stability in Uganda's financial markets.

## Time Travel
### End of 2024 Estimates
<img src="Assets/Tableau Charts/Forecast of Average Interbank Rates.png" alt="2024 Forecast of Average Interbank Rates"/>

<p><i>In examining Uganda's interbank rates from July 2023 to June 2024, we observed a forecasted increase in rates for the period from July to December 2024. The average seven-day rate is expected to rise to 11.3392%, the overnight rate to 10.8884%, and the overall rate to 10.9189%, compared to June 2024 averages of 10.7580%, 9.8070%, and 10.1060%, respectively. This projected rise suggests higher short-term lending costs due to anticipated economic conditions or monetary policy adjustments, reflecting tighter liquidity conditions or increased demand for short-term funds. The general upward trend in interbank lending rates indicates a cautious approach by financial institutions in response to expected economic developments.</i></p>
