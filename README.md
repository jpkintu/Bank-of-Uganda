<h1 style="text-align: center;">Navigating Ugandaâ€™s Interbank Currents: A Data Odyssey</h1>
## 1. Introduction
Picture this: In the heart of East Africa, a nation's economic destiny unfolds in the quiet exchanges between banks. Every day, financial institutions in Uganda engage in a delicate dance of lending and borrowing, their moves choreographed by a single, powerful number - the interbank rate. This rate, often overlooked by the general public, holds the power to influence everything from the cost of your next business loan to the interest earned on your savings account.

"The interbank rate is the heartbeat of a nation's financial system," as renowned economist John Maynard Keynes once observed. "It sets the rhythm for economic growth and stability."

In this project, we embark on a journey through time, unraveling the intricate tapestry of Uganda's interbank rates from 2012 to 2024.

### Why does this matter?
Interbank rates are more than just numbers on a banker's ledger. They are the invisible hand that shapes monetary policy, influences inflation, and ultimately affects the financial well-being of every Ugandan citizen. By understanding these rates, we gain insight into the nation's economic health, its challenges, and its triumphs.

This analysis will take you from the dizzying heights of 2012, where rates peaked at a staggering 18.879% for 7-day rates, to the valleys of recent years where rates have moderated. We'll explore the factors behind these fluctuations, from global economic pressures to local policy decisions, painting a vivid picture of Uganda's financial landscape.

As we dive into this data, we're not just crunching numbers; we're telling the story of a nation's economic journey. We'll uncover the tales hidden in the trends, the dramas played out in the dips and spikes, and the potential future written in the current trajectories.

Join me as we decode the language of Uganda's interbank rates, transforming raw data into a compelling narrative of economic resilience, challenge, and transformation. Whether you're a finance enthusiast, a policy maker, or simply curious about the forces shaping East Africa's economies, this analysis promises to shed light on the subtle yet powerful forces driving Uganda's financial markets.

Buckle up for a journey through the peaks and troughs of Uganda's financial heartbeat - a story told through the lens of interbank rates, where every percentage point has a tale to tell.
## 2.	Understanding the Data
### Trends in Uganda's Interbank Rates (2012-2024)
Our journey into Uganda's financial landscape begins with an overview of the interbank rates from 2012 to 2024. This analysis provides a bird's-eye view of the trends and fluctuations in the country's financial system over more than a decade.

Let's start by examining the visual representation of the data:
<img src="Assets/Tableau Charts/Avg inter bank rates over years(2012-2024).png" alt="Avg inter bank rates over years(2012-2024)"/>
<p align="center"><i>This graph illustrates the annual mean rates for three key metrics: the overnight rate, the seven-day rate, and the overall rate. Each line tells a story of Uganda's economic journey, with peaks and troughs reflecting various economic conditions and policy decisions.</i></p>
#### Key Observations:
**Peak in 2012:** The most striking feature of this graph is the pronounced peak in 2012. During this year, we observed the highest rates across all three categories.

<img src="Assets/Tableau Charts/Average Interbank Rates by month 2012.png" alt="Avg Interbank Rates by month 2012"/>
<p><i>Looking further into 2012; The average interbank rates for 2012 were remarkably high compared to subsequent years. The overall rate averaged 16.64%, with the seven-day rate reaching an average of 18.96% and the overnight rate at 15.23%.
January 2012 saw the highest rates of the year, with the overnight rate at 25.90%, the seven-day rate at 28.54%, and the overall rate at 26.65%. This spike suggests a period of significant financial stress or tight monetary policy at the beginning of the year.
Throughout the year, we observe a general downward trend in rates. By September, the overnight rate had decreased to 10.00%, indicating a substantial easing of monetary conditions over the course of the year.
Throughout 2012, the seven-day rate consistently remained higher than the overnight rate, with an average spread of about 3.73 percentage points. This spread suggests a premium for longer-term lending, reflecting higher perceived risks or expectations of rate changes.
The rates show considerable volatility throughout the year. For instance, the overnight rate fluctuated from a high of 25.90% in January to a low of 10.00% in September, representing a range of nearly 16 percentage points.</i></p>

**General Downward Trend:** Following the 2012 peak, we see a general downward trend in all three rates. This decline indicates a gradual easing of monetary policy over the years, potentially aimed at stimulating economic growth by reducing borrowing costs.

. Convergence of Rates: As we move towards more recent years, we notice a convergence of the three rates. This narrowing spread between overnight and seven-day rates could indicate increased stability and predictability in the short-term money market.
. Recent Uptick: Towards the end of the observed period (2023-2024), we see a slight upturn in rates. This recent increase might signal a shift in monetary policy stance, possibly in response to changing economic conditions or inflationary concerns.
. Volatility: The graph reveals periods of significant volatility, particularly in the earlier years. This volatility gradually decreases over time, suggesting an increasing maturity and stability in Uganda's financial markets.

#### Implications:
. Monetary Policy Evolution: The overall downward trend in rates from 2012 to 2024 reflects a generally accommodative monetary policy stance. This approach likely aimed to support economic growth by keeping borrowing costs low.
. Economic Cycles: The fluctuations in rates over the years may correspond to Uganda's economic cycles, reflecting periods of growth, inflation concerns, and external economic shocks.
. Financial Market Development: The gradual smoothing of rate volatility and the convergence of different tenors suggest a maturing financial market, with improved liquidity management and more efficient pricing of short-term risks.
. Policy Responsiveness: The sharp changes in rates, particularly the 2012 peak and subsequent rapid decline, demonstrate the Bank of Uganda's ability to respond decisively to economic conditions through its monetary policy tools.
